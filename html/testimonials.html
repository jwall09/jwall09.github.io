                    <p>
                        To Whom it may concern,<br><br>

                        I am writing in hopes that you will take the time to consider Max Wallace for a position in your
                        company. For the 7 years I have had the pleasure of knowing Max, I could tell you that he has always
                        been an imperative part of the team he works in.<br><br>
                        
                        I first brought Max on as an inexperienced cook at
                        Blackbird and Henry in 2014. This fact never deterred him from striving to do the very best he could for
                        himself and his coworkers. He was instantly a part of the team and viewed highly by his peers because
                        of his approachable personality, willingness to learn, and tenacious work ethic. He always had a knack
                        for bringing out the best of the people around him and made sure to work hard and elevate the
                        performance of himself and the team. There were growing pains for him, but these never slowed him
                        down or discouraged him. He always asked how to do it better next time or how to fix what was done. I
                        like to think that this comes from my tutelage, but this is from his own constant work to better himself
                        and others. He was the most dependable employee I had.<br><br>

                        Fast-forward to now, I can tell you the experiences he has learned in the service industry have
                        pushed him to be a better person and employee with the potential to move into a leadership role. He is
                        kind but not willing to lower his standards. He will make sure the people around him are reaching their
                        standards too. He has a magnetic personality, and people tend to listen when he talks. If you are to hire Max, 
                        I can ensure you that you will be pleased with the quality and standard he will bring to your
                        company.<br><br>

                        Thank you,<br>
                        Nicholas Amato<br>

                    <h2>Brandon Fuller</h2>

                    <p>
                        To whom it may concern,<br><br>

                        My name is Brandon Fuller and I have worked in Austin as a chef for the last 15 years. Max
                        Wallace was a member of our team at Juliet for several years and I highly recommend him for a
                        position with your company.<br><br>

                        Max started with us without much kitchen experience but quickly grew into a very valuable
                        member of our team. His work ethic, ability to learn new tasks quickly, and willingness to help
                        his fellow team members stand out to me to this day. Max also displayed a calmness under
                        pressure that was impressive for someone with his level of experience at that time.<br><br>

                        If Max came to me today looking for a job, I would rehire him in a second. I strongly believe any
                        organization he chooses to join will benefit from his employment. He is an excellent employee
                        and an excellent person.<br><br>
                    
                        Sincerely,<br>
                        Brandon Fuller<br>
